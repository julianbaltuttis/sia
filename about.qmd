I suck at remembering stuff, which is why I've put together this collection of notes, references, and tutorials about
anything that catches my fancy. This site is essentially my personal knowledge base, so it mainly covers areas my
professional life touches on: Computer Science, Mathematics, and an occasional dash of Graphic Design.

A heads-up: I use OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, to help generate some of the content here. So, there’s that. Neither
the chatbot nor I are infallible—we don’t always get things right. I make no claims about the accuracy or correctness of
the content posted here. But hey, if you come across something egregiously wrong, feel free to drop me a line at
