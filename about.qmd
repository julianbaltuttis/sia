These articles primarily serve as my personal notes and references, aimed at enhancing my work efficiency and learning. They tackle challenges I encounter in my professional life, especially in the areas of computer science, mathematics, and graphic design. The content is generated in collaboration with OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, also known as ChatGPT.

While I strive for accuracy and clarity, I cannot guarantee the correctness of all information, given the automated nature of the content generation. Therefore, all information is provided 'as is' and without warranty of any kind. Readers are encouraged to verify information independently.

By sharing these notes publicly, I hope to assist anyone with similar interests or those eager to explore these fields, regardless of their current knowledge level. Each article is categorized by complexity level to ensure accessibility. While these notes are a reflection of my learning journey, I welcome engagement and the exchange of ideas to foster a shared learning experience.
