# Testing JavaScript Code in IntelliJ

IntelliJ IDEA provides a powerful and feature-rich development environment for JavaScript programming. In this quick guide, we'll walk you through the simple steps to create a JavaScript project, write your code, and run it in a console using IntelliJ IDEA. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will help you get started with testing and executing your JavaScript applications seamlessly within the IDE

1. Launch IntelliJ IDEA and click on "File" -> "New" -> "Project".
2. In the project creation window, make sure to select "JavaScript" as the project type or language. Click on "Create".
3. IntelliJ IDEA will create a new JavaScript file for you, named something like "hello.js". This file will contain sample code.
4. Open the "hello.js" file and replace the sample code with your own JavaScript code. You can write any JavaScript code you want to test.
5. Right-click on the "hello.js" file in the project explorer.
6. From the context menu, select "Run" to execute your JavaScript code.
7. IntelliJ IDEA will run your JavaScript file in a console window, and you'll see the output of your code displayed in the console.

That's it! You've successfully tested and run a JavaScript app in IntelliJ IDEA using a console. You can modify the JavaScript code in the "hello.js" file, re-run it, and observe the updated results in the console window.

Note that this guide assumes you have already installed Node.js on your system, as it provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
