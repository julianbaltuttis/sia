# Create a new Vue Project

Creating a new Vue project is a straightforward process that offers flexibility in terms of command-line or browser-based approaches. Whether you prefer using PowerShell or Vue UI, this guide will walk you through the steps to create a new Vue project, allowing you to start building dynamic and interactive web applications using Vue.js.

### Create a new Vue project

1. Open PowerShell or a command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to create your project.
3. Run the following command:

   ```
   vue create project-name
   ```

   Replace `project-name` with the desired name for your project.

4. Choose an installation option by selecting from the available presets or manually selecting features.
5. Once the project is created, navigate into the project folder using `cd project-name`.
6. To run the application, use the command:

   ```
   yarn serve
   ```

   This will start a development server, and you can access your Vue application in the browser.

### Create a Vue project using Vue UI

1. Open PowerShell or a command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   vue ui
   ```

   This will start the Vue UI interface in your default browser.

By following these steps, you'll be able to create a new Vue project either through the command line using PowerShell or through the browser-based Vue UI. Both methods provide different workflows for project creation, allowing you to choose the one that suits your preferences and requirements.
