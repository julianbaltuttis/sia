# Understanding Basic Matrix Notation

*Matrices play a fundamental role in numerous fields, including computer graphics, physics, and data science. We'll familiarize ourselves with the basic definition of a matrix and the notation used to represent it.* 

## Definition (Matrix) 

A **matrix** is a structured, rectangular arrangement of numbers, split into rows and columns. The dimensions of a matrix are defined by its number of rows (m) and columns (n), typically notated as $m \times n$. A **square matrix** is a special case where the number of rows equals the number of columns, i.e., $m = n$. Two matrices are equal if they have the same dimensions and if every corresponding element within them is identical.

## Example:

Let's consider the following matrix $M$, which is a $3 \times 3$ square matrix:

$$
M = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 3 \\
5 & 2 & 1 \\
-2 & 0 & 8  \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Matrix notation can vary, but the structure and values of the matrix remain the same. For instance, matrix $M$ could also be written using parentheses, like so:

$$
M = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 3 \\
5 & 2 & 1 \\
-2 & 0 & 8  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

In both cases, the matrix $M$ stays consistent, only the enclosing symbols differ.

Grasping the basics of matrices and their notation is the first step to understanding their powerful applications in various domains. Stay tuned for more on matrices and their operations!
