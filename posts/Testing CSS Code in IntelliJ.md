# Set Up a Dummy HTML/CSS Project in IntelliJ

*Create a dummy HTML project using IntelliJ IDEA, allowing you to quickly test HTML and CSS code.*

Open IntelliJ and follow these steps to create a dummy project:

## Steps in IntelliJ

1. **Create a New Project:** On the welcome screen, click on `New Project`.
2. **Select Project Type:** In the `New Project` window, on the left side, choose `HTML` under the list of project
   types.
3. **Enter Details:** Enter a name for your project and specify its location, then click on `Create`
4. **Create an HTML file:** Right-click on the `src` folder (or wherever you'd like your HTML file to live), hover
   over `New`, then click `HTML File`. Give it a name and click `OK`.
5. **Create a CSS file:** In the same way, you can create a new CSS file. Right-click the directory where you'd like
   your CSS file to live, hover over `New`, then click `Stylesheet`. Name the CSS file and click `OK`.
6. **Link CSS to HTML:** In your HTML file, add a link to your CSS file in the `<head>` section like
   this: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` (replace "styles.css" with the path to your CSS file, if needed).
7. **Run Your Project:** To view your project, right-click the HTML file and select `Open in Browser`. Choose your
   preferred browser from the provided list.

You're all set! Now you can start experimenting with HTML and CSS in IntelliJ IDEA. Remember to save your changes before
refreshing the browser to see the results. Enjoy creating and testing!
