# Safeguard Your Site: Creating a Deploy Key for GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages provides an easy and straightforward way to host your static website directly from your GitHub repository.
Sometimes, you may need to create a "deploy key" for secure access between your repository and an external service. This
tutorial guides you through creating a deploy key specifically for GitHub Pages.

**Steps to Create a Deploy Key:**

1. **Generate a new SSH key:** Open your terminal, and use the `ssh-keygen` command to create a new SSH key. Add a label
   to the end of the command to help you identify this key later. For example:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

   When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location. When asked to
   enter a passphrase, you can either set one or leave it blank, then press Enter.

2. **Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:** To copy the contents of the SSH key to your clipboard, use the `cat` command,
   replacing the path with the path to your newly generated key, like so:

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
    ```

   If the `clip` command is not available, you can simply open the file in a text editor and manually copy the contents.

3. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub repository:** Navigate to your GitHub repository in a web browser. Click on "
   Settings" at the top of the repository page, then click on "Deploy keys" in the left-hand sidebar. Click on "Add
   deploy key", paste your SSH key into the "Key" field, give it a title, and click "Add key".

Now, you have a deploy key specifically for GitHub Pages, enhancing the security of your repository.

**Remember:** A deploy key is read-only by default, but you can give it write access when adding it to your repository
if needed. Use this feature with caution, as it allows the service with the deploy key to write to your repository.

That's it! You've created a deploy key for your GitHub Pages site, enhancing the security of your deployment process.
This approach is particularly useful when you are using external services or continuous integration systems for your
deployment. Remember to manage your keys responsibly to maintain the integrity and security of your project.
